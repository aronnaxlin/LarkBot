# LarkBot bot image (Feishu/Lark mode; TDLib is never loaded at runtime).
#
# Build:
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t larkbot:arm64 --load .
# Or through deploy/docker-compose.yml, which also builds the sandbox image.
# docs/deploy.md prefers building off-host and transferring with `docker save`
# / `docker load`; on-host builds work too but need ~2 GB of builder cache.
#
# Node is pinned to 24.18.1 deliberately. better-sqlite3 11 has no prebuild for
# Node 24's ABI, so `pnpm install` compiles it from source against this image's
# headers. Node 24.19.0+ ships the broken cleanup-hook backport
# (nodejs/node#65446): an addon compiled against 24.19+ headers aborts the
# process the first time a statement is finalized, while one compiled against
# <=24.18.1 headers runs on any 24.x. Both stages stay on 24.18.1 so the
# runtime matches the headers the addon links against.
#
# Debian trixie rather than bookworm: lottie-frame links librlottie, and
# Debian's librlottie 0.1 headers already declare the four-argument
# Animation::loadFromData() that the repo's lottie-frame patch calls (bookworm
# happens to ship the same version, but trixie matches the target host and has
# a current openssh-client).

# arm64/Node 24. libpng-dev + librlottie-dev are lottie-frame's link headers.
